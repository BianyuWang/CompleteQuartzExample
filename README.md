The total length of the poem is 8 sentences, and when the loading is complete, a timer will start to count down to 10 seconds and re-loading

01/07 Finally implemented the pause and resume for global trigger, although not quite the same as I understand, but there is no functional problem ion, 
Remember, this is only a quick experimental project, and will continue to add interesting features at next stage.
happy every day to mySelf
